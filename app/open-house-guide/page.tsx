  {
    question: 'Do I need an agent to attend an open house?',
    answer:
      'No. You can attend open houses without an agent. Having your own buyer\'s agent, however, protects your interests: they represent you in negotiations, help you understand forms and disclosures, and can give you access to off-market opportunities. Dr. Jan Duffy can serve as your exclusive buyer\'s agent while you explore Summerlin open houses.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What forms will I sign?',
    answer:
      'It depends on the relationship you want with the agent at the open house. You may see: (1) an Open House Visitor Non-Agency Disclosure acknowledging the listing agent represents the seller; (2) a Limited Property Representation Agreement if you want the agent to share property details for a limited time (e.g. up to 30 days); or (3) a Full Exclusive Buyer Representation Agreement if you want that agent to represent you formally. You are not required to sign a buyer agreement just to walk through an open house.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Who pays the buyer\'s agent?',
    answer:
      'After the August 2024 NAR settlement, buyer broker compensation is no longer displayed on the MLS. Compensation is now negotiated directly between you and your buyer\'s agent. Discuss fees and services with your agent upfront. Dr. Jan Duffy can explain how representation and compensation work for buyers in the Summerlin market.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I still tour homes without committing to an agent?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Open houses are the easiest way to tour homes without committing to an agent. They remain exempt from the rule that requires a signed buyer agreement before viewing a home in a private showing. You can visit as many open houses as you like, sign in at each, and only formalize representation when you\'re ready.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why should I work with Dr. Jan Duffy?',
    answer:
      'Dr. Jan Duffy brings local expertise in Summerlin West, certification as a luxury specialist, and a research-driven approach to every client. She helps buyers navigate the new disclosure and compensation landscape, negotiate confidently, and find the right home in neighborhoods like The Ridges, Red Rock Country Club, and Summerlin Centre.',

              <p>
                After the August 2024 NAR settlement, several rules changed how open houses and buyer
                representation work. Here&apos;s what you need to know in plain language.
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Buyer broker compensation is no longer displayed on the MLS.</strong> You
                  won&apos;t see it on listing sites; it&apos;s negotiated between you and your
                  agent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Agents must present disclosure forms at open houses.</strong> You may be
                  asked to acknowledge who represents whom before or during the visit.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Three types of forms you may encounter:</p>
              <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Open House Visitor Non-Agency Disclosure</strong> — Acknowledges that the
                  listing agent at the open house represents the seller, not you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Limited Property Representation Agreement</strong> — Allows the agent to
                  share property details with you for a limited period (e.g. up to 30 days) without
                  a full exclusive buyer relationship.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Full Exclusive Buyer Representation Agreement</strong> — A formal
                  agent-buyer relationship where that agent represents you in the transaction.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p className="rounded-lg bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 p-4 font-medium text-gray-900">
                <strong>Important:</strong> Open houses remain <strong>exempt</strong> from the
                requirement to sign a buyer agreement before viewing. You do not have to commit to
                an agent just to walk through an open house. That&apos;s a key advantage of
                attending open houses instead of private showings.
